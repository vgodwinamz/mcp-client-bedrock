# Building Custom Client Applications with Amazon Bedrock and Model Context Protocol (MCP)

In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, developers need flexible ways to interact with large language models (LLMs) while maintaining control over their applications. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for applications to communicate with AI models, and when combined with Amazon Bedrock's powerful foundation models, it creates a robust platform for building intelligent applications. In this post, we'll explore how to build custom client applications using the MCP client SDK and Amazon Bedrock Tool use.

What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface that allows applications to communicate with AI models through a consistent API. It enables developers to:

* Connect to multiple model servers simultaneously
* Discover available tools and capabilities
* Execute tool calls across different services
* Maintain conversation context and history

When paired with Amazon Bedrock's extensive model catalog, MCP provides a powerful framework for building AI-powered applications.

## Introducing the bedrock-mcp-client Project

The bedrock-mcp-client is a Python-based implementation that combines Amazon Bedrock's foundation models with MCP servers. It provides both a CLI interface for interactive use and a programmable API for integration into custom applications. 

The project consists of two main components:

CLI Client: A command-line interface for interacting with MCP servers using Amazon Bedrock models
Web UI: A browser-based interface built with FastAPI for a more visual interaction experience

## Key Features

* Multi-server support: Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
* Model selection: Choose from a wide range of Amazon Bedrock models including Claude, Llama, Mistral, and more
* Tool discovery: Automatically discover and use tools available on connected servers
* Conversation memory: Maintain context across multiple interactions
* Rate limiting: Built-in protection against API throttling
* Caching: Response caching to improve performance and reduce costs
* Web interface: User-friendly browser-based UI for non-technical users

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture with several key components:

BedrockClient: Handles communication with Amazon Bedrock's API
MCPServerConnection: Manages connections to individual MCP servers
GeneralMCPBedrockClient: Orchestrates interactions between Bedrock and MCP servers
ChatMemory: Maintains conversation history and context
API: FastAPI-based web interface for browser access

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.12 or higher
* AWS credentials with access to Amazon Bedrock
* Access to one or more MCP servers

### Installation

#### Clone the repository
```
git clone git@ssh.gitlab.aws.dev:vgodwin/mcp-remote-client.git
```

#### Create a virtual environment
```
python3.12 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

#### Configuration

The client uses a configuration file mcp.json file to store server information. Here's an example configuration:


```{
"mcpServers": {
    "postgresql": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://mcp-pg.agentic-ai-aws.com/sse",
            "--transport",
            "sse-only"]
                  }
             }
}
```


You can add additional servers by editing this file or using the client's API.

Using the CLI Client

The CLI client provides an interactive interface for working with MCP servers:


### Start the client with default settings
```
python3 -m bedrock_mcp_postgres --region us-west-2
```

#### Connect to specific servers
```
python3 -m bedrock_mcp_postgres --servers <MCP Server1>,<MCP Server1> --region <AWS Region>
```


Once connected, you can: 

```
Query: tools
```
to command to list available tools


### Using the Web Interface

The project also includes a web interface built with FastAPI:


#### Start the web server
```
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000 to access the interface, which provides:

* A form to connect to MCP servers
* Model selection from available Bedrock models
* A chat interface for interacting with the models
* Response history and context management

### Building Custom Applications

The modular design makes it easy to integrate the client into your own applications:

```
from bedrock_mcp_postgres import GeneralMCPBedrockClientimport asyncio
async def run_client():
    # Initialize the client with your preferred region
    client = GeneralMCPBedrockClient(region_name="us-west-2")
    
    try:
        # Connect to servers (or specific ones)
        connected_servers = await client.connect_to_servers(["postgresql"])
        print(f"Connected to: {connected_servers}")
        
        # Process a query
        response = await client.process_query("What tools are available?")
        print(response)
        
        # Call a specific tool
        result = await client.call_tool("postgresql", "query_database", {
            "query": "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5"
        })
        print(result)
        
    finally:
        # Clean up resources
await client.cleanup()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_client())
```

## Advanced Features

### Tool Mapping and Discovery

The client automatically maps tools from MCP servers to a format compatible with Bedrock models:

#### Get all tools from connected servers
```
tools = await client.list_tools()
```

#### Format tools for Bedrock
```
bedrock_tools, tool_mapping = client.bedrock_client.format_tools_for_bedrock(server_tools)
```

### Conversation Memory Management

The client maintains conversation history and can generate summaries:


#### Add messages to memory
```
client.memory.add_user_message("Any slow queries in database?")
client.memory.add_assistant_message("Yes, generate_ticket_activity function experincing delays while batch inserting the data into tickets table.")
#Get conversation summary
summary = client.memory.summary
```

### Rate Limiting and Error Handling

Built-in rate limiting protects against API throttling:
```
The client automatically handles rate limiting with exponential backoff and jitter
response = await client.process_query("Complex query requiring multiple tool calls")
```

## Supported Models

The client supports a wide range of Amazon Bedrock models, including:

* Anthropic Claude 3, 3.5, and 3.7 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
* Amazon Nova (Pro, Lite, Micro)
* Meta Llama 3.1 and 3.2
* Mistral (Large, Small)
* and more

Each model is available in multiple AWS regions, making it easy to choose the right model for your specific needs.

## Use Cases

The Custom MCP Client for Amazon Bedrock is versatile and can be used for various applications:

* Database Interaction: Connect to PostgreSQL databases through MCP and use natural language to query data
* Document Analysis: Process and analyze documents using specialized MCP tools
* Multi-agent Systems: Create systems where multiple specialized agents collaborate
* Interactive Chatbots: Build chatbots that can access external tools and data sources
* Data Processing Pipelines: Create workflows that combine AI with data processing tools

## Conclusion

The Custom MCP Client provides a powerful foundation for building custom applications that leverage Amazon Bedrock's foundation models and the flexibility of the Model Context Protocol. By combining these technologies, developers can create sophisticated AI applications that can interact with multiple services, maintain context, and provide rich user experiences.
Whether you're building a simple CLI tool or a complex web application, the modular architecture and comprehensive feature set make it easy to get started and scale as your needs grow.
